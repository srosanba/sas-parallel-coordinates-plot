## Parallel Coordinates Plots in SAS

A parallel coordinates plot is used to visualize multivariate data ([google image results](https://www.google.com/search?q=parallel+coordinates+plot&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh5uKv_JLSAhVBjlQKHYe9DGEQ_AUICCgB&biw=1010&bih=892)). I could only find one example of such a plot being created with SAS, in a [SGF 2012 paper](https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings12/267-2012.pdf) by Prashant Hebbar of SAS.
